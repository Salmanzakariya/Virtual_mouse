# Virtual_mouse
A virtual mouse in Python using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Autopy leverages computer vision to track hand movements and gestures via a webcam. OpenCV captures video, Mediapipe detects hand landmarks, and Autopy simulates mouse actions, enabling control of the cursor without physical input devices.
